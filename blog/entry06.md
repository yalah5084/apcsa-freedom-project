### Takeaways from Expo Elevator Pitch

After the expo and delivering the [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q1kv5fxVlAfcq-0ERWnh0_SLryxskqKYo2vqAg-qa18/edit) with my group, I feel like we should have had more confidence when presenting the final product to the judges because we were a little awkward. Not only do we have to speak with more confidence, but also clearly in order to effectively communicate the purpose of our recipe app to the judges. Additionally, it's crucial to have a backup plan because the code preview in Xcode wasn't loading fast enough, which made us lose valuable time and the judges didn't get to ask us questions. However, we remembered we had a video of the recipe app; always be prepared for technical difficulties.

### Takeaways from in-class presentation

After the in-class [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fzJTYPV8W36z7rmppDt6pjyQiK0mtnq6svw637Mek8o/edit#slide=id.p), we received feedback about making the transition from the recipe app to the auto-cutter smoother because our transition was confusing. People found it hard to follow with our transition from the software component to the hardware component as they didn't know how they were connected.

### Engineering Design Process and Skills

Finally, we're in the last stage of the engineering design process which is communicating the results. There's still a feature we have to finish working on which is allowing the user to save their own recipe. Lastly, three skills I developed were collaboration, organization, and communication. My group and I communicated our ideas to create the final products and organized ourselves to present it in the expo and class. Throughout the entire project, a lot of collaboration was required to ensure to the efficiency of the product and presentations.

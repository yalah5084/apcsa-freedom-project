Tool: **Swift**

* [Swift documentation tutorial](https://www.swift.org/getting-started/swiftui/)
* [SwiftUI tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views)
* Learned about VStack and deleted the first VStack --> the text and circle disappeared, why?
* Add volleyball figure
* Tried putting different sports but some of them wouldn't appear, maybe there's different casing and name

* `Spacer()` adds space. If you put multiple, the spaces will be divided equally
* `withAnimation()` function to create a smoother transition between each activity. It can be customized with `.easeInOut(duration: 0.5)`
*  The description of the tutorial about adding `.transition(.slide)` and `.id(id)` was confusing because it didn't show an example of the code. I reread the previous paragraphs and it started to make more sense. I put them after the inner `VStack`. I also put it after the button and the button was also sliding with the circle and icon

# APCSA Freedom Project
by **Yala Huang**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For the project, my teammates [David](https://github.com/davidkevinl7792), [Hanna](https://github.com/hannal7626), [Chanry](https://github.com/chanryc9471) and I made a recipe app for user to explore different recipes ideas. I chose to independently study Swift and this blog will walk through my process of independently studying my tool.

## Implications
##### PROS
* People can potentially sell their recipes
* New job opportunities to manage the app
* Convenient when you don't have a physical cookbook
* Inspire people to cook and even be creative in the kitchen
* Connect with other people through food by sharing recipe ideas
* Quick and easy-to-find recipe ideas whenever you're unsure about what to cook
##### CONS
* Competition with other recipe apps
* Inaccuracy in some recipes can lead to misinformation and disappointment in users
* Rely too much on the app to the point of diminishing cooking skills or creativity in the kitchen
